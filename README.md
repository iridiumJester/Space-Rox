# Space Rox!

Made using tutorials created by GameMaker. The videos are unlisted, so I've linked them individually.

## Added Details

**Features**
* Backwards: Down key to reverse.
* Friction: When up is not pressed, the player gradually slows down.
* Speed limit: Ship cannot surpass a set speed. 
* All of these were because I kept flying around the screen and being unable to stop.

**Visuals**
* At the start of the game (does not happen on respawns!) score and lives have a delayed appearance. This is for the music.
* Customized start and end screens with fun gradients.
* On start screen, enter clears all text on screen and waits (via alarm) 1.5 seconds before moving to the game room. This is for the music.
* Lives and score change color based on value.
* On either end screen, enter clears the screen briefly before restarting. I feel this gives an illusion of the game "processing" the input.
* Sprite "glow" effect.

### Sound
All sounds made by me using [UltraaBox](https://ultraabox.github.io/).

**Music**
* Title screen loop (4 sec)
* At game start, non-looping extension of intro that leads into main (2 sec)
* Main theme loop (48 sec)

**Sound Effects**
* Blip (enter is pressed)
* Die
* Lose
* Win
* Zap (shot bullet)

## ***Notes***: 

* All sprites and audio are my original work.
* I take no credit for the concepts.
